## 1. Cogflow Integration with Informer: Time-Series Forecasting MLOps

### 1.1 Time-Series Forecasting with Informer

#### 1.1.1 Informer Architecture Overview

The Informer model architecture utilized in this integration employs several innovative components that enhance time-series forecasting capabilities. The ProbSparse Self-attention mechanism achieves O(L log L) time and memory complexity, significantly improving efficiency for long input sequences. Self-attention distilling progressively extracts dominant attention patterns by removing redundancies, further enhancing computational efficiency.

The architecture implements multi-scale temporal feature extraction, capturing different time granularities through hierarchical encoder structures. This approach allows the model to recognize patterns at various temporal resolutions simultaneously.

Key features include:
- ProbSparse Self-attention for efficient processing
- Multi-scale temporal feature extraction
- Generative style decoder for coherent forecasting
- Support for both univariate and multivariate data
- Efficient processing of long input sequences

#### 1.1.2 Integration with Cognitive Framework

The integration with CF provides a comprehensive MLOps solution for deploying Informer models. Key integration points include:

1. **Model Management**:
```python
class InformerModel(cf.pyfunc.PythonModel):
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.config = config
        self.model = None

    def load_context(self, context):
        self.model = Informer(**self.config)
        self.model.load_state_dict(context.artifacts['model_state'])

    def predict(self, context, input_data):
        return self.model.forecast(input_data)
```

2. **Experiment Tracking**:
```python
# Set up experiment
cf.set_experiment("Time-Series-Forecasting")
cf.pytorch.autolog()

with cf.start_run(run_name='informer_training') as run:
    # Log parameters
    cf.log_param("seq_len", args.seq_len)
    cf.log_param("pred_len", args.pred_len)
    
    # Train and log metrics
    cf.log_metric("train_loss", loss)
    cf.log_metric("val_mae", mae)
```

3. **Model Registry and Deployment**:
```python
# Register model
model_info = cf.pyfunc.log_model(
    artifact_path='informer_model',
    python_model=model,
    artifacts={"model_state": "model.pth"},
    signature=signature
)

# Deploy model
deployment = cf.ModelServing.deploy(
    serving_config=config,
    endpoint_name="informer-prod"
)
```

### 1.2 Implementation Examples

The implementation is structured as a CF pipeline that orchestrates three main components. Before diving into the specific components, let's understand the pipeline structure:

```python
@cf.pipeline(name="informer-pipeline", description="Informer Time-Series Forecasting Pipeline")
def informer_pipeline(file, isvc):
    # Preprocessing stage
    preprocess_task = preprocess_op(file=file)
    
    # Training stage
    train_task = training_op(
        file=preprocess_task.outputs['output'],
        args=preprocess_task.outputs['args']
    )
    
    # Serving stage
    serve_task = kserve_op(model_uri=train_task.output, name=isvc)
    serve_task.after(train_task)
```

Each component is created as a CF component using:
```python
component_op = cf.create_component_from_func(
    func=component_function,
    output_component_file='component.yaml',
    base_image='burntt/nby-cogflow-informer:latest',
    packages_to_install=[]
)
```

#### 1.2.1 Data Preprocessing Framework

The preprocessing component handles data preparation and configuration:

```python
def preprocess(file_path: cf.InputPath('CSV'), 
              output_file: cf.OutputPath('parquet'), 
              args: cf.OutputPath('json')):
    # Load and convert data
    df = pd.read_csv(file_path, header=0, sep=";")
    
    # Track directory structure
    directory_data = {
        'exp': os.listdir('exp'),
        'models': os.listdir('models'),
        'utils': os.listdir('utils'),
        'data': os.listdir('data')
    }
    df['directory_data'] = directory_data
    df.to_parquet(output_file)
    
    # Configure Informer hyperparameters
    args_dict = {
        'experiment_name': 'small_exp_1',
        'model': 'informer',
        'data': 'alibaba_pod',
        'seq_len': 12,
        'label_len': 12,
        'pred_len': 6,
        'enc_in': 1,
        'dec_in': 1,
        'c_out': 1,
        'd_model': 32,
        'n_heads': 4,
        'e_layers': 1,
        'd_layers': 1,
        'd_ff': 128,
        # Additional configuration parameters...
    }
```

#### 1.2.2 Model Training System

The training component implements comprehensive model training and evaluation:

```python
def training(file_path: cf.InputPath('parquet'), args: cf.InputPath('json'))->str:
    # Setup environment and dependencies
    sys.path.extend(['/', '/exp', '/models', '/utils'])
    
    # Initialize experiment tracking
    cf.autolog()
    cf.pytorch.autolog()
    experiment_id = cf.set_experiment(
        experiment_name="Custom Model Informer Time-Series"
    )
    
    # Training loop with error handling
    try:
        with cf.start_run(run_name='custom_model_run_informer', nested=True) as run:
            # Configure model settings
            setting = '{}_{}_ft{}_sl{}_ll{}_pl{}_dm{}_nh{}_el{}_dl{}_df{}_at{}_fc{}_eb{}_dt{}_mx{}_{}_{}'.format(...)
            
            # Log parameters
            cf.log_param("seq_len", args.seq_len)
            cf.log_param("n_heads", args.n_heads)
            cf.log_param("enc_lay", args.e_layers)
            cf.log_param("pred_len", args.pred_len)
            
            # Train and evaluate
            model = exp.train(setting)
            test_results = exp.test(setting)
            
            # Log metrics
            cf.log_metric("mae", test_results['mae'])
            cf.log_metric("mse", test_results['mse'])
            cf.log_metric("rmse", test_results['rmse'])
            cf.log_metric("r2", test_results['r2'])
            
            # Save model
            model_info = cf.pyfunc.log_model(
                artifact_path='informer-alibaba-pod',
                python_model=exp,
                artifacts=artifacts,
                input_example=input_df,
                signature=signature
            )
```

#### 1.2.3 Deployment Infrastructure

The serving component implements KServe-based model deployment:

```python
def serving(model_uri, name):
    # Initialize Kubernetes client
    config.load_incluster_config()
    api_instance = client.CustomObjectsApi()
    current_namespace = open("/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/namespace").read()
    
    # Create inference service
    inference_service = {
        "apiVersion": "serving.kserve.io/v1beta1",
        "kind": "InferenceService",
        "metadata": {"name": name},
        "spec": {

                    "storageUri": model_uri
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    # Deploy service
    api_instance.create_namespaced_custom_object(
        group="serving.kserve.io",
        version="v1beta1",
        namespace=current_namespace,
        plural="inferenceservices",
        body=inference_service
    )
```

#### 1.2.4 Pipeline Execution

The pipeline can be executed using the CF client:

```python
client = cf.client()
client.create_run_from_pipeline_func(
    informer_pipeline,
    arguments={
        "file": "/data/processed_data.csv",
        "isvc": "informer-serving-inference"
    }
)
```

#### 1.2.5 Monitoring and Performance Metrics

The implementation tracks several key metrics:

1. **Time Series Metrics**:
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
   - RÂ² Coefficient

2. **Automatic Logging**:
```python
